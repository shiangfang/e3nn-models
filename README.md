# e3nn-models

Here we use e3nn to build the following generalized models based on the NequIP architecture:

1. Generalized energy model to include the electric field dependence for molecules.

2. Tensorial models to predict the Born effective charges (node prediction task) and the dielectric matrices (graph prediction task) relevant for the electric dipole-dipole interactions that affect the phonons near $\vec{q} \rightarrow 0$.
